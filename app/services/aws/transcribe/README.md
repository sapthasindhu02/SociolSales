1. Asking for Permission to Use the Microphone

First, the app requests permission from the user to access the microphone. If the user doesn't allow this, the app will stop, and nothing else can proceed.
2. Preparing to Record Audio

Once the user grants permission, the app prepares to record audio using the microphone. The app will set up the microphone so that it can capture high-quality audio in real-time.
3. Setting Up a WebSocket Connection to AWS Transcribe

The app then connects to AWS Transcribe (a cloud service that converts speech to text) using a WebSocket. A WebSocket is like a two-way phone call between the app and the server, where both can send and receive messages in real-time.

To make this connection secure, the app creates a special signed URL using AWS credentials. This URL ensures that only authorized users can connect to AWS Transcribe.
4. Capturing and Sending Audio to AWS

While the app is recording audio, it constantly listens for any updates from the microphone. Every time the app captures a chunk of audio, it fetches that recorded sound and sends it to AWS Transcribe through the WebSocket connection.
5. Receiving Transcriptions from AWS

As AWS Transcribe listens to the audio being sent, it converts the speech to text. The text (or transcription) is then sent back to the app via the WebSocket connection. The app can display this transcription in real-time, allowing users to see what they are saying as they speak.
6. Stopping the Recording

When the user stops recording, the app stops capturing audio from the microphone and also closes the WebSocket connection to AWS Transcribe. This means no more audio is sent, and no more transcriptions are received.
